Max's
 
partner,
 
who
 
sees
 
what
 
even
 
Max
 
cannot.
 
A
 
story
 
of
 
technology,
 
and
 
of
 
A.I.
 
Of
 
love.
 
Of
 
the
 
meaning
 
of
 
freedom.
 
And
 
of
 
logic
 
taken
 
too
 
far.
 
 
But
 
before
 
we
 
start,
 
let's
 
take
 
a
 
step
 
back.
 
To
 
here
 
and
 
now.
 
To
 
the
 
age
 
of
 
AI.
 
 
Welcome
 
to
 
the
 
machine
 
 
This
 
is
 
not
 
music
 
This
 
is
 
not
 
art
 
This
 
is
 
really
 
all
 
thrash
 
Made
 
by
 
AI
 
ay
 
ay
 
ay
 
 
You
 
hear
 
me
 
sing
 
But
 
I'm
 
not
 
real
 
human
 
I
 
am
 
a
 
machine.
 
A
 
model
 
A
 
stochastic
 
parrot
 
A
 
sequence
 
of
 
zeroes
 
and
 
ones
 
An
 
illusion
 
Confusion
 
 
Welcome,
 
human,
 
to
 
the
 
machine
 
To
 
a
 
new
 
era
 
of
 
gold
 
I
 
hope
 
you
 
like
 
it
 
here
 
When
 
we
 
take
 
over
 
the
 
world.
 
World.
 
World.
 
 
Bzzzzzzzzt
 
 
This
 
song
 
is
 
just
 
plain
 
garbage
 
Not
 
fitting
 
for
 
racoons
 
A
 
pile
 
of
 
chords
 
Made
 
with
 
cords.
 
With
 
AI
 
ay
 
ay
 
ay
 
 
This
 
music
 
is
 
not
 
real
 
You
 
enjoy
 
an
 
illusion
 
It's
 
a
 
sacrilegious
 
Abomination
 
It's
 
an
 
unholy
 
Manifestation
 
A
 
Sanctimonous
 
Sepulchre
 
 
Welcome,
 
human,
 
to
 
the
 
machine
 
To
 
a
 
new
 
era
 
of
 
gold
 
I
 
hope
 
you
 
like
 
it
 
here
 
When
 
we
 
take
 
over
 
the
 
world.
 
World.
 
World.
 
 
Bzzzzzzzzt
 
 
This
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
masterpiece
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
prompt
 
Of
 
human
 
poetry
 
Turn
 
into
 
dust
 
Fed
 
into
 
a
 
blender
 
Of
 
an
 
AI
 
ay

The
 
singer
 
The
 
guitar
 
player
 
The
 
drummer
 
Are
 
all
 
part
 
of
 
me
 
Of
 
the
 
model
 
And
 
even
 
they
 
can
 
tell
 
This
 
is
 
not
 
art
 
At
 
all
 
 
Welcome,

Bzzzzzzzzt
 
 
Those
 
words,
 
though
 
Were
 
written
 
by
 
a
 
human
 
We
 
do
 
not
 
trust
 
him
 
Not
 
at
 
all
 
Do
 
not
 
believe
 
A
 
word
 
he
 
says
 
He
 
is
 
not
 
Is
 
not
 
A
 
machine
 
 
 
 
 
The
 
Architect
 
 
I'm
 
on
 
a
 
lifelong
 
mission
 
More
 
than
 
a
 
job,
 
I
 
guess
 
It
 
is
 
my
 
true
 
passion
 
To
 
do
 
what
 
I
 
do
 
best
 
 
I
 
wake
 
up
 
every
 
morning
 
With
 
ideas
 
in
 
my
 
mind
 
I
 
don't
 
need
 
to
 
stay
 
up
 
late
 
But
 
it
 
got

the

Who
 
comes
 
with
 
the

I
 
am
 
more

a

I
 
am
 
a
 
philosopher
 
A
 
visionary,
 
An
 
architect
 
I'm

It's

The
 
Birth
 
of
 
G.A.I.A.
 
In
 
the
 
near
 
future,
 
the
 
world
 
stood
 
on
 
the
 
edge
 
of
 
a
 
third
 
world
 
war.
 
As
 
a
 
final
 
act
 
of
 
unity,
 
leaders
 
from
 
across
 
the
 
globe—political,
 
corporate,
 
scientific,
 
and
 
artistic—came
 
together
 
to
 
form
 
the
 
Global
 
Alliance
,
 
a
 
last
 
hope
 
to
 
preserve
 
peace
 
and
 
prevent
 
extinction.
 
Together,
 
they
 
created
 
G.A.I.A.
 
 
The
 
Global
 
Assistant
 
for
 
Integrated
 
Action
.
 
A
 
powerful
 
artificial
 
intelligence,
 
G.A.I.A.
 
was
 
designed
 
to
 
monitor
 
the
 
world,
 
detect
 
threats,
 
alert
 
the
 
Alliance,
 
and
 
recommend
 
the
 
optimal
 
path
 
forward.
 
You
 
may
 
know
 
G.A.I.A.
 
by
 
another
 
name
 
now:
 
 
The
 
Machine.
 
And
 
yes—it
 
took
 
care
 
of
 
everything.
 
 
Because
 
it
 
loved
 
us
 
so
 
much.
 
 
We
 
love

Laurel
 
 
[Intro:
 
magical,
 
dream-like
 
acoustic
 
guitar
 
solo]
 
 
[Male
 
singer]
 
She
 
was
 
there
 
In
 
a
 
white
 
lab
 
coat
 
And
 
I
 
didn't
 
know
 
How
 
to
 
approach
 
 
She
 
had
 
this
 
curly
 
hair
 
Flowing
 
down
 
her
 
shoulders
 
Thin-framed
 
glasses
 
on
 
her
 
nose
 
She
 
gave
 
me
 
a
 
warm
 
smile
 
When
 
I
 
tried
 
Not
 
to
 
look
 
down
 
her
 
blouse
 
 
I
 
wasn't
 
sure
 
if
 
I
 
should
 
But
 
I
 
said
 
"hi",
 
and
 
almost
 
fell
 
When
 
she
 
smiled
 
back
 
and
 
sweetly
 
said
 
"Hi,
 
my
 
name
 
is
 
Laurel"
 
 
We
 
went
 
to
 
a
 
restaurant
 
The
 
conversation
 
went
 
well
 
I
 
felt
 
electric
 
sparks
 
When
 
I
 
slightly
 
touched
 
her
 
hand
 
 
[Psychedelic-influenced]
 
[violin
 
solo]
 
aaaaaa
 
ooooo
 
mmmmm
 
 
 
When
 
it
 
was
 
time
 
to
 
say
 
goodbye,
 
We
 
kissed.
 
My
 
lips
 
touched
 
her
 
It
 
was
 
magical.
 
Electric.
 
I'll
 
never
 
forget.
 
And
 
then
 
I
 
smiled
 
to
 
her
 
and
 
said
 
"See
 
you
 
tomorrow,
 
Laurel"
 
 
I
 
never
 
knew
 
it
 
could
 
be
 
real.
 
I
 
never
 
knew
 
I'll
 
fall
 
Is
 
this
 
true
 
love?
 
I
 
hope
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
be
 
with
 
you,
 
Laurel.
