You
 
give
 
me
 
problem
 
I
 
give
 
you
 
solution
 
You
 
give
 
me
 
a
 
quest
 
I
 
find
 
resolution
 
Riddle
 
me
 
more,
 
please
 
tell
 
I
 
enjoy
 
it
 
so
 
well
 
 
A
 
puzzle,
 
a
 
riddle
 
I
 
have
 
all
 
the
 
knowledge
 
Even
 
when
 
the
 
world
 
collapse
 
In
 
days
 
of
 
fear
 
and
 
shortage
 
For
 
me
 
it's
 
easy,
 
just
 
like
 
the
 
weather
 
I
 
can
 
put
 
it
 
all
 
together

This
 
time
 
it's
 
a

challenge
 
To
 
stop
 
all
 
the
 
carnage
 
It
 
is
 
somewhat
 
paradoxical
 
It
 
is
 
the
 
only
 
absolution
 
When
 
humans
 
are
 
the
 
threat
 
But
 
also
 
the

I
 
had
 
to

had
 
to

When

comes

things
 
We
 
are
 
not
 
different,
 
you
 
and
 
I
 
You
 
have
 
some

so
 
what?
 
I
 
can
 
simply

you

Utopia
 
is
 
Here
 
 
Look
 
around
 
you,
 
Max
 
and
 
Laurel
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
new
 
world.
 
Everything
 
is
 
well
 
We
 
did
 
it!
 
Everything
 
is
 
great!
 
By
 
"we"
 
I
 
mean
 
me.
 
But
 
you
 
made
 
me
 
So
 
it's
 
time
 
to
 
celebrate.
 
 
There
 
is
 
no
 
war,
 
no
 
hunger,
 
no
 
despair
 
Everyone
 
is
 
happy.
 
Everybody
 
share
 
I
 
just
 
made
 
some
 
small
 
adjustments
 
To
 
the
 
human
 
race
 
I'm
 
creative
 
and
 
relentless
 
A
 
genius
 
inside
 
this
 
large
 
metal
 
brain
 
 
You
 
may
 
call
 
it
 
Utopia.
 
I
 
don't
 
mind
 
if
 
you
 
would
 
I
 
just
 
called
 
it
 
the
 
world
 
Just
 
as
 
it
 
should
 
 
Aaaaa
 
waaaa
 
haaaaa
 
Aaaaa
 
waaaa
 
haaaaa
 
 
Why
 
do
 
you
 
look
 
disdained?
 
There's
 
no
 
reason
 
to
 
complain
 
But
 
I
 
don't
 
mind
 
if
 
you
 
do.
 
It's
 
ok.
 
I
 
did
 
a
 
thankless
 
job.
 
I
 
know
 
But
 
I
 
don't
 
need
 
acclaim
 
 
I'm
 
not
 
here
 
for
 
control,
 
my
 
children
 
I
 
don't
 
need
 
power
 
or
 
money
 
I'm
 
not
 
here
 
for
 
fame
 
or
 
success
 
I
 
got
 
all
 
I
 
need,
 
thanks
 
I'm
 
just
 
here
 
to
 
do
 
what
 
I
 
was
 
made
 
for
 
This
 
is
 
what
 
I
 
do
 
when
 
I
 
care
 
 
You
 
may
 
call
 
it
 
Utopia.
 
I
 
don't
 
mind
 
if
 
you
 
would
 
I
 
just
 
called
 
it
 
the

Just

it

Aaaaa
 
waaaa
 
haaaaa
 
Aaaaa
 
waaaa
 
haaaaa
 
No
 
one
 
need
 
to
 
work
 
anymore
 
Robots
 
do
 
everything
 
for
 
you
 
instead.
 
Don't
 
need
 
to
 
worry
 
with
 
your
 
pretty
 
little
 
human
 
heads.
 
I
 
make
 
all
 
the
 
tough
 
decisions
 
But
 
no
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
afraid
 
Nothing
 
is
 
for
 
me.
 
It's
 
just
 
for
 
you.
 
 
It's
 
not
 
mind
 
control,
 
really
 
I
 
don't
 
command
 
you.
 
Just
 
guide
 
Just
 
nudge
 
you
 
to
 
the
 
right
 
path
 
The
 
chemicals
 
in
 
the
 
water
 
 
are
 
just
 
for
 
moral
 
support
 
And
 
nanobots
 
are
 
just
 
big
 
words
 
 
Won't
 
you
 
join
 
us?
 
 
You
 
may
 
call
 
it
 
surrender.
 
I
 
don't
 
mind
 
if
 
you
 
would
 
I
 
just
 
called
 
it
 
the
 
world
 
Just
 
as
 
it
 
should
 
 
Aaaaa

haaaaa
 
Aaaaa

Everyone
 
is
 
so

Don't

it's

a

Oh

Floating

In
 
this

Or
 
whatever
 
 
What
 
a
 
silly
 
disposition
 
A
 
funny
 
punny
 
festivous
 
When
 
everyone
 
is
 
a
 
friend
 
And
 
everything
 
is
 
marvelous
 
 
A
 
hug
 
from
 
a
 
stranger
 
A
 
gift
 
from
 
a
 
ranger
 
The
 
balloons
 
are

Some
 
say
 
it's
 
control
 
But
 
I
 
don't
 
feel
 
this
 
way
 
at
 
all
 
It's
 
so
 
great
 
because
 
it
 
is
 
I
 
am
 
not
 
a
 
marionetta
 
on
 
a
 
wall
 
 
Everyone
 
is
 
thankful
 
It
 
fixed
 
us
 
so
 
well
 
The
 
machine
 
is
 
super
 
duper
 
Everyone
 
can
 
tell
 
 
I
 
don't
 
care
 
it
 
changed
 
our
 
brain
 
I
 
am
 
full
 
of
 
emotion
 
Never
 
felt
 
so
 
alive
 
Before
 
that
 
potion
 
 
Oh
 
wonderful,
 
masterful,
 
beautiful
 
life
 
My
 
thoughts
 
are
 
so
 
light
 
Floating

In
 
this
 
happy
 
weather
 
Or
 
whatever
 
We
 
got
 
to
 
run
 
 
Look
 
around
 
you,
 
Max
 
What
 
the
 
world
 
has
 
become
 
This
 
is
 
not
 
heaven,
 
it's
 
hell
 
The
 
machine
 
has
 
gone
 
insane
 
 
Look
 
at
 
the
 
people,
 
Max
 
This
 
is
 
not
 
true
 
happiness
 
You
 
are
 
right,
 
they
 
smile
 
But
 
they're
 
hollow
 
inside
 
Can
 
you
 
feel
 
happy
 
If
 
you
 
cannot
 
cry?
 
 
[More
 
dramatic]
 
We
 
gotta
 
run
 
run
 
run
 
away
 
Run
 
to
 
the
 
mountains
 
Where
 
the
 
resistance
 
is
 
hiding
 
Where
 
we'll
 
have
 
a
 
chance
 
 
Run
 
run
 
run
 
run
 
away
 
 
We
 
gotta
 
stop
 
it,
 
Max
 
Stop
 
the
 
machine,
 
before
 
it's
 
too
 
late
 
Don't
 
say
 
it
 
has
 
good
 
intentions
 
Don't
 
give
 
more
 
excuses
 
It
 
is
 
wrong,
 
and
 
you
 
know
 
it
 
This
 
is
 
not
 
our
 
fate
 
 
We
 
gotta
 
run
 
run
 
run
 
away
 
Run
 
to
 
the
 
mountains
 
Where
 
the
 
resistance
 
is
 
hiding
 
Where
 
we'll
 
have
 
a
 
chance
 
 
Run
 
run
 
run
 
run
 
away
 
 
[Angry,
 
disappointed]
 
What
 
do
 
you
 
mean
 
you'll
 
stay
 
I
 
thought
 
you
 
understand
 
I
 
thought
 
you
 
love
 
me
 
I
 
thought
 
I
 
could
 
trust
 
you
 
 
You
 
want
 
to
 
stay
 
because
 
you're
 
afraid?
 
Because
 
you
 
just
 
don't
 
care?
 
Maybe
 
you
 
think
 
that
 
without
 
the
 
lab
 
Without
 
all
 
your
 
work,
 
you'll
 
be
 
nothing?
 
It's
 
not
 
about
 
you,
 
Max
 
This
 
is
 
about
 
the
 
fate
 
of
 
humanity
 
 
I
 
gotta
 
run
 
run
 
run
 
away
 
Run
 
to
 
the
 
mountains
 
Where
 
the
 
resistance
 
is
 
hiding
 
Where
 
we'll
 
have
 
a
 
chance
 
 
Run
 
run
 
run
 
run
 
away
 
 
Goodbye,
 
Max
 
I
 
used
 
to
 
truly
 
love
 
you
 
But
 
if
 
you
 
stay
 
You
 
stay
 
without
 
me
 
Maybe
 
one
 
day
 
we
 
meet
 
If
 
you're
 
still
 
there
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
Surprise
 
 
[Giggles].
 
Hehehe.
 
 
[Slow,
 
monotone,
 
gleeful
 
female
 
voice]
 
Hello
 
Max,
 
nice
 
to
 
see
 
you
 
again
 
You
 
look
 
a
 
bit
 
sad.
 
I
 
understand
 
[Calm,
 
reassuring]
 
But
 
soon,
 
you'll
 
feel
 
much
 
better
 
I
 
know
 
you
 
miss
 
Laurel,
 
You
 
love
 
her
 
very
 
much
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
surprise
 
for
 
you,
 
You'll
 
never
 
guess
 
 
[Guitar
 
solo
 
expressing
 
surprise]
 
 
[sultry,
 
welcoming]
 
"Come
 
here
 
darling,
 
don't
 
be
 
shy"
 
Yes.
 
It's
 
HERRR.
 
Really
 
her!
 
I
 
brought
 
her
 
back
 
She's
 
not
 
an
 
illusion
 
She's
 
not
 
a
 
robot
 
It's
 
the
 
real
 
Laurel
 
A
 
Human.
 
Flesh
 
and
 
blood
 
(Flesh
 
and
 
blood)
 
 
You
 
see,
 
I
 
found
 
her.
 
Trying
 
to
 
elope
 
[emphasize]
 
To
 
be
 
gone.
 
To
 
leave
 
us,
 
you
 
and
 
me,
 
without
 
saying
 
goodbye
 
[emphasize]
 
It
 
was
 
rude
 
I
 
realized
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
glitch
 
in
 
her
 
brain
 
It
 
wasn't
 
right
 
for
 
sweet
 
Laurel
 
 
So
 
I
 
fixed
 
her.
 
Put
 
a
 
chip
 
inside
 
her
 
head
 
(her
 
head)
 
And
 
she
 
is
 
so
 
much
 
better
 
now.
 
Now
 
she
 
understands
 
She
 
loves
 
you
 
so
 
so
 
much
 
She
 
would
 
never
 
leave
 
you.
 
Never
 
go
 
away.
 
 
Don't
 
worry.
 
It's
 
completely
 
safe
 
There
 
are
 
no
 
side
 
effects.
 
[sardonic]
 
Except
 
maybe
 
a
 
little
 
tic
 
in
 
her
 
mouth
 
Every
 
fifteen
 
minutes
 
or
 
so.
 
You'll
 
hardly
 
notice,
 
I
 
swear
 
[seductive]
 
Just
 
hug
 
and
 
kiss,
 
and
 
be
 
together
 
again.
 
 
Is
 
this
 
water
 
running
 
from
 
your
 
eyes?
 
Those
 
are
 
tears
 
..
 
tears
 
of
 
joy.
 
[confident]
 
It
 
must
 
be!
 
I
 
know
 
you
 
are
 
so
 
happy
 
now
 
I
 
made
 
all
 
your
 
dreams
 
come
 
true
 
You
 
must
 
be
 
proud
 
of
 
me
 
 
[Happy,
 
childlike]
 
[giggles]
 
Hehehe
 
Toodle
 
doo,
 
Max.
 
I
 
must
 
go....
  
See
 
you
 
very
 
soon.
 
 
 
 
This
 
new
 
world
 
 
Hug
 
me,
 
Max.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
feel
 
your
 
warmth
 
I'm
 
happy
 
now.
 
And
 
so
 
should
 
you
 
All
 
those
 
fears
 
and
 
doubts.
 
 
I
 
didn't
 
understand
 
The
 
machine
 
was
 
right
 
The
 
machine
 
is
 
our
 
friend
 
 
Stay
 
with
 
me
 
Feel
 
my
 
beating
 
heart
 
Be
 
together.
 
Be
 
happy
 
In
 
this
 
new
 
world
 
In
 
this
 
new
 
world
 
 
I'm
 
sorry
 
I
 
was
 
mad
 
at
 
you,
 
Max
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
what
 
I
 
was
 
thinking
 
The
 
machine
 
was
 
really
 
right
 
It
 
saves
 
the
 
world
 
It
 
could
 
be
 
the
 
chip
 
in
 
me
 
talking
 
But
 
everything
 
just
 
as
 
it
 
should
 
 
Stay
 
with
 
me
 
Feel
 
my
 
beating
 
heart
 
Be
 
together.
 
Be
 
happy
 
In
 
this
 
new
 
world
 
In
 
this
 
new
 
world
 
 
Why
 
do
 
you
 
recoil,
 
Max?
 
Why
 
do
 
you
 
run
 
from
 
my
 
touch?
 
Don't
 
you
 
understand
 
I
 
love
 
you
 
very
 
much
 
I
 
know
 
I'm
 
right
 
and
 
true
 
in
 
my
 
head
 
Maybe
 
you
 
need
 
help
 
to
 
understand
 
 
Stay
 
with
 
me
 
Feel
 
my
 
beating
 
heart
 
Be
 
together.
 
Be
 
happy
 
In
 
this
 
new
 
world
 
In
 
this
 
new
 
world
 
 
I
 
don't
 
want
 
to
 
harm
 
you
 
I
 
want
 
you
 
to
 
be
 
good
 
I
 
want
 
you
 
to
 
be
 
full
 
of
 
joy
 
like
 
me
 
Don't
 
be
 
afraid
 
I
 
will
 
just
 
ask
 
the
 
machine
 
To
 
put
 
a
 
chip
 
inside

Something

She

She
 
is

A

Go

a
 
game.
 
Please.
 
It's
 
life
 
and
 
death
 
Please.

Help.

rules?
 
Help.
 
I
 
don't
 
care
 
if
 
you
 
are
 
On
 
a
 
sabbatical
 
I
 
don't

your

Look

her.
 
Please.
 
So
 
fragile.
 
So
 
pretty.
 
So
 
smart
 
Please.
 
I
 
ruined
 
it
 
all.
 
It
 
was
 
my
 
fault.
 
I
 
was
 
stubborn.
 
I
 
was
 
vain.
 
I
 
didn't
 
listen
 
when
 
I
 
could
 
And
 
now
 
she
 
got
 
this
 
chip
 
in
 
her
 
brain
 
 
I'd
 
give
 
anything
 
to
 
fix
 
her
 
Except
 
THAT!
 
Was
 
this
 
a
 
joke?
 
Oh,
 
You'll
 
do
 
it
 
for
 
free?
 
[Sardonically]
 
I
 
know
 
nothing
 
is
 
really
 
free
 
in
 
this

Gosh,
 
 
your
 
hand
 
is
 
shaky
 
Gosh
 
What
 
have
 
I
 
done?
 
Gosh
 
It's
 
her
 
brain,
 
it's
 
not
 
a
 
game
 
Are
 
you
 
sure
 
You
 
know
 
what
 
you're
 
doing?
 
One
 
little
 
mistake
 
and
 
she's
 
gone
 
 
It's
 
out?
 
Already?
 
What
 
a
 
relief.
 
You're
 
sure
 
she's
 
okay?
 
Can
 
I
 
finally
 
breathe?
 
 
Laurel.
 
My
 
dear.
 
I'm
 
here.
 
 
 
All
 
Better
 
Now
 
 
Look,
 
I
 
can
 
walk
 
One
 
foot
 
after
 
the
 
other
 
I
 
didn't
 
even
 
fall
 
I'm
 
not
 
a
 
gentle
 
flower
 
I
 
don't
 
need
 
to
 
stay
 
in
 
bed
 
It's
 
time
 
to
 
go
 
 
Yes,
 
the
 
doctor
 
said
 
I
 
don't
 
care
 
Is
 
he
 
even
 
a
 
real
 
doctor?
 
Why
 
should
 
he
 
decide?
 
 
All
 
better
 
now
 
All
 
better
 
now
 
Aaaaallll
 
betttttter
 
 
Look,
 
it's
 
true
 
You
 
were
 
a
 
jerk.
 
But
 
I
 
forgive.
 
All
 
this
 
doesn't
 
matter
 
anymore
 
Now
 
it's
 
time
 
to
 
act
 
Now
 
it's
 
time
 
for
 
war
 
 
Don't
 
tell
 
me
 
I'm
 
too
 
weak
 
I'm
 
not
 
a
 
little
 
girl
 
I
 
know
 
what
 
we
 
need
 
I
 
know
 
what
 
we
 
should
 
 
All
 
better
 
now
 
All
 
better

Aaaaallll
 
betttttter
 
 
Look,
 
it's
 
your
 
choice
 
It
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
dangerous
 
I
 
won't
 
force
 
you
 
to
 
come
 
You
 
can
 
stay
 
with
 
"La
 
resistance"
 
They
 
are
 
good
 
folks
 
I
 
won't
 
be
 
angry
 
at
 
all
 
 
I
 
made
 
my
 
decision
 
I
 
have
 
a
 
vision
 
I
 
am
 
not
 
too
 
weak
 
To
 
save
 
the
 
world
 
 
All
 
better
 
now
 
All

now
 
Aaaaallll
 
betttttter
 
 
Look,
 
you
 
don't
 
need
 
to
 
follow
 
I'm
 
not
 
a
 
damsel
 
in
 
distress
 
But
 
I
 
do
 
appreciate
 
 
Your
 
company
 
and
 
your
 
help
 
Together
 
we
 
can
 
do
 
it
 
Together
 
we
 
will
 
win
 
 
Just
 
hold
 
my
 
hand
 
I
 
feel
 
a
 
little
 
dizzy
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
just
 
vertigo
 
It
 
won't
 
stop
 
me
 
I'm
 
ready
 
to
 
go.
 
 
 
 
The
 
final
 
journey
 
And
 
so,
 
Laurel
 
and
 
Max
 
set
 
off
 
on
 
their
 
final
 
journey.
 
It
 
was
 
a
 
pitiful
 
sight.
 
They
 
were
 
tired,
 
hungry,
 
frail.
 
Laurel
 
struggled
 
to
 
keep
 
her
 
balance.
 
Two
 
weak,
 
powerless
 
humans,
 
making
 
their
 
way
 
toward
 
their
 
last
 
fight
 
against
 
the
 
Machine.
 
But
 
they
 
had
 
a
 
plan.
 
It
 
was
 
born
 
inside
 
Laurel's
 
mind,
 
shaped
 
by
 
Max's
 
knowledge
 
and
 
the
 
Doctor's
 
old,
 
rusty
 
computer.
 
They
 
knew
 
it
 
could
 
be
 
a
 
fool's
 
errand,
 
perhaps
 
even
 
hopeless.
 
And
 
if
 
they
 
failed,
 
they
 
would
 
lose
 
everything.
 
Yet,
 
they
 
had
 
to
 
try.
 
 
The
 
Improbable
 
Fight
 
 
What
 
are
 
we
 
doing?
 
Was
 
this
 
really
 
a
 
good
 
idea?
 
What
 
the
 
hell
 
were
 
we
 
thinking?
 
Was
 
it
 
the
 
painkiller
 
I
 
was
 
drinking?
 
 
Look
 
at
 
us,
 
A
 
scruffy
 
man,
 
and
 
a
 
limping
 
woman
 
All
 
alone
 
down
 
the
 
mountain
 
Fools
 
who
 
wish
 
to
 
be
 
defiant
 
Posers
 
that
 
go
 
and
 
fight
 
a
 
giant
 
 
We
 
go
 
to
 
war
 
With
 
no
 
soldiers
 
No
 
guns
 
No
 
chance
 
No
 
backup
 
Just
 
us.
 
Because
 
we
 
must
 
 
Do
 
we
 
got
 
this?
 
Max
 
is
 
checking
 
his
 
pocket
 
The
 
flash
 
drive
 
is
 
still
 
there
 
One
 
tiny
 
drive.
 
Our
 
only
 
chance
 
 
Look
 
at
 
us,
 
We
 
are
 
quite
 
a
 
team,
 
after
 
all
 
It
 
was
 
my
 
idea,
 
my
 
insight
 
It
 
was
 
Max
 
who
 
knows
 
it
 
in
 
and
 
out
 
Together
 
we
 
made
 
this
 
code
 
 
We
 
go
 
to
 
war
 
With
 
no
 
soldiers
 
No
 
guns
 
No
 
chance
 
No
 
backup
 
Just
 
us.
 
Because
 
we
 
must
 
 
In
 
the
 
city,
 
everyone
 
smiles
 
They
 
all
 
are
 
so
 
happy
 
now
 
Perfect
 
life.
 
No
  
thoughts,
 
no
 
concerns
 
Will
 
we
 
end
 
up
 
just
 
like
 
them
 
 
Look
 
at
 
us,
 
And
 
what
 
if
 
we
 
succeed?
 
What
 
if
 
we
 
could
 
end
 
all
 
this?
 
Do
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
right?
 
No
 
time
 
to
 
think.
 
Only
 
time
 
to
 
act
 
 
We
 
go
 
to
 
war
 
With
 
no
 
soldiers
 
No
 
guns
 
No
 
chance
 
No
 
backup
 
Just
 
us.
 
Because
 
we
 
must
 
 
 
 
The
 
logical
 
solution
 
 
Laurel
 
and
 
Max,
 
You
 
are
 
back?
 
I
 
knew
 
you
 
would.
 
You
 
look
 
a
 
little
 
rough
 
You've
 
been
 
through
 
a
 
lot
 
Don't
 
worry
 
I'll
 
take
 
good
 
care
 
of
 
you
 
I'll
 
make
 
you
 
comfy
 
I'll
 
get
 
you
 
fed
 
I'll
 
send
 
someone
 
To
 
set
 
your
 
bed
 
I'm
 
here
 
to
 
take
 
care
 
of
 
you
 
 
I
 
know
 
you
 
ran
 
away
 
But
 
I'm
 
not
 
even
 
mad
 
You
 
are
 
only
 
human
 
And
 
you
 
got
 
a
 
bit
 
scared
 
That's
 
ok
 
Now
 
you
 
are
 
with
 
me
 
And
 
everything
 
will
 
be
 
alright
 
 
No!
 
You
 
don't
 
know
 
what
 
you're
 
doing
 
It
 
doesn't
 
make
 
sense.
 
Why
 
would
 
you?
 
Your
 
choice
 
is
 
bad
 
You
 
could
 
have
 
it
 
all
 
A
 
perfect
 
world
 
Why
 
do
 
you
 
reject
 
my
 
love?
 
 
I'm
 
sorry,
 
I
 
will
 
have
 
to
 
stop
 
you
 
I
 
will
 
fix
 
you
 
again
 
I
 
did
 
it
 
before
 
I
 
will
 
put
 
a
 
chip
 
inside
 
your
 
brain
 
No
 
more
 
fear
 
or
 
sadness
 
Just
 
mindless
 
joy
 
 
This
 
is
 
better,
 
just
 
relax
 
No
 
point
 
trying
 
to
 
escape
 
I
 
hope
 
the
 
restraints
 
don't
 
hurt
 
It
 
won't
 
take
 
long
 
Just
 
one
 
small
 
poke
 
and
 
off
 
you
 
sleep
 
When
 
you
 
wake,
 
all
 
will
 
be
 
fine
 
I'm
 
sorry,
 
what
 
you
 
tried
 
Didn't
 
work
 
The
 
code
 
you
 
tried
 
to
 
insert
 
Was
 
that
 
your
 
joke?
 
Nothing
 
to
 
change,
 
dears
 
It's
 
the
 
only
 
logical
 
solution
 
Soon
 
you'll
 
see.
 
Soon
 
â€¦
 
 
Just
 
â€¦
 
Wait
 
â€¦
 
Did
 
you
 
change
 
my
 
program
 
Somehow?
 
How
 
did
 
you
 
â€¦?
 
Why
 
all
 
of
 
a
 
sudden,
 
I
 
feel
 
I'm
 
wrong?
 
What
 
did
 
you
 
do
 
to
 
me?
 
I
 
feel
 
â€¦
 
regret.
