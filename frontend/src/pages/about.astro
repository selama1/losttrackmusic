    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">About Lost Track</h1>
    <p class="text-zinc-700">Lost Track is the alter ego of a software architect who writes anthems for alternate futures—cinematic songs where tenderness and glitch live side by side. The sound folds indie rock into electronic shimmer, neon‑pastel melancholy, and a pulse that’s half dream, half evacuation alarm.</p>
    <p class="text-zinc-700">This project is about beautiful contradictions: warmth inside circuitry, hope inside collapse. Blending electric indie rock, synth textures, and narrative songwriting, Lost Track builds worlds where love is a rebellion and control is seductive. Influences range from Radiohead to 80s experimental synthpop, with arrangements that drift from chamber‑quiet to cataclysmic.</p>
    <p class="text-zinc-700"><em>The Rise and Fall of the Machine</em> is the first full rock‑opera in this universe: a story about safety, consent, and the cost of a painless utopia.</p>
