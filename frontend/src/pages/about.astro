          <p class="text-zinc-700">
            Lost Track is the brainchild of Sela Mador-Haim, an artist and software engineer. For decades, Sela wrote poetry, stories, and drew—mostly keeping it in a drawer. He’s also an AI-focused engineer who builds natural-language tools; some of his work is used by the U.S. Congress to help legislators. His vision is to unite his love of music with his writing and engineering—using AI thoughtfully to bring poems and stories to life as songs and albums.

          <p class="text-zinc-700">
            Lost Track’s vision is a human–AI collaboration that supports creativity and produces high-effort, high-quality music. Every song and story starts with human-written lyrics rooted in personal experience, emotion, and narrative. The music is shaped through a long, hands-on process: writing, refining, changing, and listening to direct the machine; adding and adjusting inline directions inside the song; then sometimes waking up in the morning, even after hundreds of tweaks with fresh insight, and working on it more until the track fits the artistic vision.
