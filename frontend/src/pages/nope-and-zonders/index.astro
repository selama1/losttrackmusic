    lyrics: `When I look back at my life
Ehmmm
I could be [*pause*] proud

I did what I should
Been a real pro-fessional
And I was quite good

[passionate, deeper low baritone voice]
I was quite good

[chorus: faster, more energetic]
Two plus two is four
Four plus four is eight
Eighteen plus six is twenty four
And I love you more

Safety in numbers
Safety in numbers

I ran the numbers
Double checked it is all great
Add box fifteen to box twenty eight
We didn't have computers
And I did it all by hand

[passionate, deeper voice]
I did it all by hand

[chorus]
Two plus two is four
Four plus four is eight
Eighteen plus six is twenty four
And I love you more

Safety in numbers
Safety in numbers

You say it's not that glorious
But it made us good dough
You say I played it safe
But at tax season, though

I always helped you save
[passionate]
always helped you save

[chorus]
Two plus two is four
Four plus four is eight
Eighteen plus six is twenty four
And I love you more

Safety in numbers
Safety in numbers`

    lyrics: `[Folk fairy tale]
Once upon a time
There was a man
A normal man
Just like the most
Not a mirage
Or a ghost

He had a wife, you know
A normal wife
Just like any other woman
Just like that
And they lived
A normal life

[chorus: harmonic choir]
Tell me more
I want to know
Please pray tell
How the story ends

The had two children
A girl and a boy
And I cannot tell a lie
They were just
Like you and I
Regular Joes

They were not bad at school
Not at all
Not too good either
Just like that
Right in the middle
And that's it

Tell me more
I want to know
Please pray tell
How the story ends

The story end
Not with a bang
But with a whimper
With a bumper sticker
A boring dad joke
And then a stroke

It was quite unexpected
Not normal at all
Not what the average family
want to be told
Luckily he survived
Everything is well

Tell me more
I want to know
Please pray tell
How the story ends`

Why have you gone?
Why did you leave me alone?

Bretta, Bretta, my love
A day with no end
Bretta, Bretta, my love
One day we'll meet again

I remember it so well
It was a sunny Sunday morning
You said you don't feel well
I was running to the phone
One moment you were there
The next you were gone

[chorus]
Bretta, Bretta, my love
A day with no end
Bretta, Bretta, my love
One day we'll meet again

I see your face everywhere I look
I see you image in the phonebook
I think of you when I'm sad
I smell you when I go to bed
I see your ghost on the TV
I see your picture, you and me

Close my eyes
And let my thoughts fly
To a different world

[chorus]
When my mind wonders
When I am lost
Before I go bonkers
And there's cost
I come back here

A place where I could
Lay my head
A place of quiet of peace
My new bed

What I would dream the most
What I would yearn most of all
Is to wave hello
Open my eyes
Faintly smile
And let my emotions flood
overcome me

Before I go bonkers

My source of duress
When my tummy is rumbling
At 11 PM

"Feed me" she says
And I Uh-blige

[Bridge: Violine solo]

[chorus: introspective]
I open the fridge
Nothing to eat
Nothing I like, anyway
So sad
So sad

This is my quandary
To eat I must
I hope you agree
An old tired man
To satisfy he must
Listen to his gut

I open the fridge
Yet once again
Nothing new there to eat
So sad
So sad

Would I just go to sleep
Lie on empty stomach?
Doctor says it's good for me
I should agree
But my intestines
Ask for spree

I open the fridge
Third time this night
No steak or dessert
So sad
So sad`

And they may go to hell

They are here to steal my mail
They are going it again
I will not let this stand

Evil clowns from outer space
Stop messing with my life
I've seen it all
I know you're there
You can no longer hide.
There is a global secrecy
An evil band of wusses
Who work for the government
And keep steal my glasses

Prey tell, you miscreants
Why do you need it?
Just leave me alone
Just go, away. Away.

[chorus]
Evil clowns from outer space
Stop messing with my life
I've seen it all
I know you're there
You can no longer hide.
There was a car at the front
It looked awfully suspicious
I do not have no visitors
I do not drive a Mercedes

So I called 911
Reported it to the police
But they are all in cahoots
They did not do zilch

Stop messing with my life

I know you're there

I will learn to ride the unicycle
I will jump on the trapeze
I will flip in the air
Everyone will be amazed

[chorus: theatrical and forceful]
Any time good for a change
To be something else
To do something strange
To dare and to hope
New tricks for old dog

It is still not too late
Even though I'm seventy eight
To learn new tricks
To fetch new bone

I am kind of alone
And I don't like it at all
But when I'm in the circus
I will have a ball

[chorus]
Any time good for a change
To be something else
To do something strange
To dare and to hope
New tricks for old dog

I saw them passing by today
With all those trailers and trucks
They are erecting a new tent
Going there is just few bucks

I will come and say hello
And show them what I can
They will be so impressed
They will ask me to join them

When I was your age, child
We didn't have smartphones
We didn't have computers
We didn't have tablets

We have this payphone
At the end of the street
We stood there in the rain
And waited for it
And we had a dime
To call again

Those were the times
The happy times
Where everything was simple
Everything was pure
What wouldn't I give
To go back

When I was your age, child
We didn't have a fridge
We didn't have a freezer
We didn't have a range

We had an icebox
To keep food cool
We had a fireplace with woods
To cook it all good
We cooked in huge cast iron pots
And it tasted so good

[chorus]
Those were the times
The happy times
Where everything was simple
Everything was pure
What wouldn't I give
To go back

When I was your age, child
We didn't have three bedrooms
We didn't have a yard
We didn't have elevators

We were all in one bedroom
With my grandpa and aunt
In a shed made of card boxes
That got soggy when it rains
And sometimes blew off
When there were trains

Those were the times
The happy times
Where everything was simple
Everything was pure
What wouldn't I give
To go back`

I sat today near the fireplace
This fake electric fireplace
Made by Amish folks
The couch is so comfy
The fake fire so warm
And I feel good

[chorus: clean, happy, harmonic]
And I think How maybe
It's so nice to be in this world
To see it all with my eyes
To live through it all
The good and the bad

I made me some eggs this morning
Breakfast was quite good
I even grilled some bacon
It came out like it should
I was satisfied
In a good mood

[chorus]
And I think How maybe
It's so nice to be in this world
To see it all with my eyes
To live through it all
The good and the bad

I had phone-call this evening
Grand-kids are just fine!
Daughter in law got new job
My son is going to the gym
For a second week in a row!
I am quite impressed

[chorus]
And I think How maybe
It's so nice to be in this world
To see it all with my eyes
To live through it all
The good and the bad`
