           Vive La Existence is the soundtrack of my life—small moments and big ones. We start with a quick stop at our family home, roll into the daily grind of parenting while bigger things crash in, ride through a rough, emotional roller coaster, then look for hope, drift into daydreams, and wonder what it all means.

Welcome to the life department
A place of wonder and despair
Have some mint tea. Step on the carpet
Of a house to which nothing can compare
<br/>
Please come and see the residence of life
The humble abode of the Mador-Haims
The dwelling of Sela, and Heather, his wife
Where nothing is quite what it seems
<br/>
Just open the door and step right inside
But beware of a black and curly beast
It is fun and messy and wild
And you're welcome to join the feast
Be wary as you step inside
With a hop and a skip, full of joy
Your world could soon turn upside down
As you trip and fall when you step on a toy
<br/>
In this wonderful place, a girl at the table
Working on a new project, Sahar is her name
And on the lazyboy chair, holding a tablet
It's Shalev, and minecraft is his game
<br/>
But only for the truly brave, and only if you wish
You can follow us to the back of beyond
Jump right into the water and swim with the fish
In a wonderful colorful natural pond
<br/>
Welcome to the life department
A place of wonder and despair
Have some mint tea. Step on the carpet
Of a house to which nothing can compare

Get up, morning comes, the cuckoo clock rings.
Get your body upright, it is seven fifteen.
Let me sleep, says you. Just a little bit more
Five minutes? Or ten? Last night you slept poor.
<br/>
Nuh-uh, you fool. Do not linger anymore.
Brush your teeth, put your shoes on and get down to first floor
The kids are probably watching TV. Make sure they got dressed, brushed their hair, and their teeth.
Food ready. Lunch in? Water bottles prepared? Shoes on? C'mmon. We are almost there.
Don't be late. Almost eight. Time is up. TV off. 
Morning struggle is done, get your stuff. Go to work.
<br/>
Another day. Another day. Another day. Another.
<br/>
Mrs. Gough. Don't doze off. It's four thirty. Again?
Work's day's done. All or none. Get back and drive.
Kids are back. Time to check. How was your camp?
Did you hit your nose? Did anyone drown? 
Did you get a new friend? Did you faint at the end? 
Never mind. Dinner's ready. Time to eat. Shower's done and then off to bed.
TV off, I said. Tablet too. No "hold on". No five more minutes. Not even one.
How 'bout good night story. Or a video, or three?
Just relax. Lay your head. And stop bouncing. On me.
Yes. I know. You are itchy. And you already slept yesterday.
But maybe, just maybe, you could sleep the whole night tonight?
<br/>
Another evening. Another evening. Another evening. Another.
<br/>
Day is done. They're all down. You are free! To do what?
Relax, lay in bed. Watch some facebook or tiktok.
Clear your head. This wasn't so bad. 
Just do some doomscrolling before going to sleep.
Tomorrow is a brand new day. Tomorrow everything could happen.
Close your eyes. And breath.
<br/>
Another night. Another night. Another night. Another.

Are you seated comfortably?
Good. The ride almost began
Rest your butt on the plastic chair
And tighten you seat belt
But don't worry if there's none 
<br/>
It will all be ok. We suppose.
And if not, tough lack. You've been warned 
It's a joyride. Enjoy it. And give us a smile
Soon you'll be asking for more
<br/>
Welcome to the roller coaster
The ride of your life
There are ups there are downs
Some parts are quite crappy
But its free, complain to no one
<br/>
You see this steep hill?
We are going to climb it
And from there, it's free fall
All the way down
Don't worry if it's scary.
 Close your eyes, and you'll be fine
<br/>
Perseverance is key, we suppose
If you lack it, tough luck. You're on your own
It's a theme park! The theme is "grimace"
Soon you will join the show
<br/>
Welcome to the roller coaster
The ride of your life
There are ups there are downs
Some parts are quite crappy
But its free, complain to no one
<br/>
Aren't you glad you are here?
Neither do we, my dear
We'll make sure you run with a scream
We know you didn't ask for it
But this ride is quite a dream
<br/>
Nausea is how it ends, we propose
Don't like it? Tough luck. Take dramamine
It's a modern torture chamber. Pretty chains!
At least you're not alone
<br/>
Welcome to the roller coaster
The ride of your life
There are ups there are downs
Some parts are quite crappy
But its free, complain to no one

 I promise you. Things are gonna get better
Like … really really better.
Like fluffy puppies and ice cream better
Like unicorns on a rainbow eating cotton candy
You just wait and see
<br/>
Look, the clouds are moving, going away
And you can see the sun shining through the cracks
Yeah, the shitstorm is already over.
And it's going to be better.
Like … really really better.
I promise you.
<br/>
Put it on your calendar. February 16th. Next year, I think.
That's when things are gonna get better.
Like … really really better
Like Disneyland, without the lines. And without the expensive ticket prices
Like a really good streak from a three michelin-star restaurant.
Yeah. That much better.
<br/>
I'm telling you. Things are going to get better.
You'll see. It will be really really better.
I'm not just saying. I fully guarantee.
I can sign you a letter. A contract. A deed.
I'll be riding on a steed. With a megaphone.
Shout so everyone could  hear, 
that things are gonna get better.
<br/>
Better than a macaroon from a taco truck in Paris
Better than a gourmet extra-special calorie-free cronut
Better than a trip to medieval Egypt
Better than a kiss at the sunset in Atlantic city
<br/>
Yeah. This much better.

It's been raining all day and all night
The newscaster says: "stay indoors"
Thunders roar like rhythmic crescendo
Beating the drums of war
<br/>
We're not worried at all
There is so much to do
Like talking and playing games.
Right?
Or, just watching Bluey again
<br/>
Cooped up
I don't mind
I don't mind at all
Being cooped up
It's good for my soul
Tra la la la la. Ha ha!
Ha ha!
<br/>
It's been raining all day and all night
So we all have some good time to kill
The children are learning to climb on walls
It is great they are learning new skills
<br/>
Could be playing with a ball
Or creatively chew our nails
Or maybe make a phone call
Right?
And telling a friend your tales
<br/>
Cooped up
I don't mind
I don't mind at all
Being cooped up
It's good for my soul
Tra la la la la. Ha ha!
Ha ha!
<br/>
The newscaster says twenty two girls
Tragically died in a texas flood
Its a horrible literal hell
Kind of good we did stay inside
<br/>
So safe and snuggly here
When the street is a river outside
There is no reason to complain
Right?
Sometimes the best thing is to hide
<br/>
Cooped up
I don't mind
I don't mind at all
Being cooped up
It's good for my soul
Tra la la la la. Ha ha!
Ha ha!

Na-na-na-na Na-na-na-na. Hey hey now
<br/>
I got this song I want to write, playing in my head
I got those words I want to say really really bad
I am going to do it right away
In any minute now
I am going to do it as soon as I finish
Some other things I started somehow
<br/>
I got to respond to this guy online
He's very very wrong
I can't just leave it hanging
Before I write this song
And I got to finish watch this clip
Which is kind of funny
And think about the government
And how to make more money
And then, just then
I will write this song
<br/>
Na-na-na-na Na-na-na-na. Hey hey now
<br/>
I will do it tomorrow
Yeah, I will do it tomorrow
I swear, I'll do it tomorrow
Or the very next day.
<br/>
I opened up the browser, started Google Docs
Even wrote the title. It's there in fancy font
I am going to write it right away
I'm so ready by now
I've been thinking of writing it all day
And I'm really ready to start
<br/>
I know once I started, it would be just wow
Once I start, the words would flow
I can't just leave it hanging
I have to write this song
It's really really consequential
Not doing it would be wrong
<br/>
Na-na-na-na Na-na-na-na. Hey hey now
<br/>
I will do it tomorrow
Yeah, I will do it tomorrow
I swear, I'll do it tomorrow
Or the very next day.
<br/>
I have a really busy day, so much to do
My plate is really really full, you know
A letter I need to send right away
I'll write it any minute now. any.
A doctor appointment I should really make
Because my nose is very runny
<br/>
And there is this deadline at work
I got to finish it tonight
I must really do it, I'm afraid
It's called deadline because if I don't
I'm as good as dead.
And I'll do it just after I finish this song instead
<br/>
Na-na-na-na Na-na-na-na. Hey hey now
<br/>
I will do it tomorrow
Yeah, I will do it tomorrow
I swear, I'll do it tomorrow
Or the very next day.

When would they respond?
When would they respond?
When would they respond to my post?
It has been ten minutes. Or five. At most.
When would they respond to my post?
<br/>
I'm sure they will. This post is fantastic.
Every word is brilliant. Majestic. Elastic.
No one can ignore this. No one could pass it
When would they respond to my post?
<br/>
I've been up all night, thinking about it
Because I really really care
And finally I managed to write it
Because I love so much to share

It's been fifteen minutes now. Maybe it got lost?
Everyone should be awake by now on the other coast
Maybe it was marked as spam, and got to jail?
Maybe the illustration was a colossal fail?

I refreshed again, but nothing ever happens
I've been idle twenty minutes, it is all in vain
Maybe I should just turn my phone off
And do something else, before I go insane
<br/>
When I'm back it would be different
Just ignore it for a while
Do something else, be indifferent
When I get back I will smile
<br/>
When? When? When would they respond to my post?

I'm back. It's been an hour. Maybe two
Had to run some errands and go around
I've been a good boy. I kept my phone close
I'm sure there are responses abound
<br/>
What? One? You must be kidding me
This is pathetic, I say.
Don't get me wrong. I appreciate that dude
But it's time to forget it and go away.

Aaaaaa  mmmm
Aaaaaa  mmmm
Aaaaaa  mmmm
<br/>
There is this place beyond the clouds
Where everything is magic
Every wish comes true
Every part is so fantastic
<br/>
There are wizards and witches
Mermaids in the sea
And magical peaches
Try them and you'll see
<br/>
Aaaaaa  mmmm
Flying away. Away
Flying away
Flying there now
To the land beyond the clouds
<br/>
There is no worry or concern
Joy and love everywhere
Every day is a carnival
And everything is for share
<br/>
Even the villains are there
Just for dramatic effect
You know they will lose at the end
No one ever gets hurt
<br/>
Aaaaaa  mmmm
Flying away. Away
Flying away
Flying there now
To the land beyond the clouds
<br/>
The logic is different and strange
We could have unusual time
But beyond the fantastic and weird
Everything has its reason and rhyme
<br/>
Everything is just as it should
And anyone can see
You could be you and nothing else
In this land of fantasy
<br/>
Aaaaaa  mmmm
Flying away. Away
Flying away
Flying there now
To the land beyond the clouds
<br/>
There is this place beyond the clouds
Which is not really there
Mere  fragment of my imagination
But I don't really care
<br/>
I go there every time
When it's dark and rainy outside
This is where I like to live
In this place inside my mind
<br/>
Aaaaaa  mmmm
Flying away. Away
Flying away
Flying there now
To the land beyond the clouds

When I was a child, I asked a wise man
"Why? Why am I me"
And he smiled back and said: 
[Sardonically. Lower voice] "I don't get it.
I have one piece of advice for you, sonny.
Stop asking stupid questions"
<br/>
When I grew up, I learned it all
About evolution and the big bang
About Cro-Magnons and Neanderthal men
It explained it all, it was all very true
But still one question abide
<br/>
Why? Why? Why are we here?
Mmmmmm
Why? Why? Why are we here?
Mmmmmm
Why are we here, when we want to be there?
<br/>
We are here because we are
We are here because we can
There is no ulterior meaning
It's only our choice that matters
It's only the meaning we give to ourselves
<br/>
Nonsense, said my child with her eyes
Don't you even dare
You are here because of us
You are here because you care
But still, the question didn't go away
<br/>
Why? Why? Why are we here?
Mmmmmm
Why? Why? Why are we here?
Mmmmmm
Why are we here, when we want to be there?
<br/>
Why when I open my eyes, do I see
The world only through me?
Why is the only voice, the voice in my head?
And how would the nothing look
When I'm dead. When I'm dead
When I'm dead?
<br/>
And do my choices really matter?
Do I really make a difference? (you'll see)
And would AI just replace us?
It is already writing songs for me.
So that one question remains
<br/>
Why? Why? Why are we here?
Mmmmmm
Why? Why? Why are we here?
Mmmmmm
Why are we here, when we want to be there?
<br/>
Why? Why?
Why ask stupid questions?
<br/>
Ha Ha. no. I don't.

Put your head 
on the pillow
Close your eyes
Clear your head
Of any thoughts
Sink into her webs
And fade away
Fade away
Fade away
<br/>
Time to forget
To rest
To pause
To disappear
<br/>
This is why
This is why
This is whyyyyyyy
We're sleeping
<br/>
Silent dreams we can't remember
Echoes from the day
Soft silhouettes
On display
Whisper in your head
Then go away
Go away
Go away
<br/>
Time to remember
To process
To be, but not to be
To regress
<br/>
This is why
This is why
This is whyyyyyyy
We're sleeping
<br/>
Aaaaaa ahaaaaaa
Aaaaaa ahaaaaaa
This is why
Aaaaaa ahaaaaaa
This is why
Aaaaaa ahaaaaaa
This is why
Aaaaaa ahaaaaaa
This is whyyyyyyy

There are days like this
With no end
There are days like this
When I'm lost
<br/>
What I would like the most
What I would want most of all
Is to lay my head down
Close my eyes
And let my thoughts fly
To a different world
<br/>
[chorus]
When my mind wonders
When I am lost
Before I go bonkers
And there's cost
I come back here
<br/>
A place where I could
Lay my head
A place of quiet of peace
My new bed
<br/>
What I would dream the most
What I would yearn most of all
Is to wave hello
Open my eyes
Faintly smile
And let my emotions flood
overcome me
<br/>
[chorus]
When my mind wonders
When I am lost
Before I go bonkers
And there's cost
I come back here

Are you seated comfortably?
Good. The ride almost began
Rest your butt on the plastic chair
And tighten you seat belt
But don't worry if there's none 
<br/>
It will all be ok. We suppose.
And if not, tough lack. You've been warned 
It's a joyride. Enjoy it. And give us a smile
Soon you'll be asking for more
<br/>
Welcome to the roller coaster
The ride of your life
There are ups there are downs
Some parts are quite crappy
But its free, complain to no one
<br/>
You see this steep hill?
We are going to climb it
And from there, it's free fall
All the way down
Don't worry if it's scary.
 Close your eyes, and you'll be fine
<br/>
Perseverance is key, we suppose
If you lack it, tough luck. You're on your own
It's a theme park! The theme is "grimace"
Soon you will join the show
<br/>
Welcome to the roller coaster
The ride of your life
There are ups there are downs
Some parts are quite crappy
But its free, complain to no one
<br/>
Aren't you glad you are here?
Neither do we, my dear
We'll make sure you run with a scream
We know you didn't ask for it
But this ride is quite a dream
<br/>
Nausea is how it ends, we propose
Don't like it? Tough luck. Take dramamine
It's a modern torture chamber. Pretty chains!
At least you're not alone
<br/>
Welcome to the roller coaster
The ride of your life
There are ups there are downs
Some parts are quite crappy
