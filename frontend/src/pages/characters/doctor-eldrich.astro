He’s exactly the kind of specialist you swear you’ll never need—until you do. People don’t go to Eldrich first; they get sent there, quietly, by those who know where the last lights still flicker. When he and Max and Laurel finally share a room, it’s because love, fear, and pragmatism have converged. What happens next depends on hands that sometimes tremble—and resolve that doesn’t. ";
