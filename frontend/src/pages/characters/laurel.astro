  "Laurel arrives in a lab coat and a smile, the kind of person who asks direct questions and means the kindness behind them. Her connection with Max is immediate—smart talk over dinner, a spark when hands brush—but she’s nobody’s accessory. She names what she sees, even when it’s uncomfortable. When the world starts calling unnatural things “normal,” Laurel won’t. She refuses the role of a damsel and insists on agency, even at a cost; her compass points to joy that doesn’t require surrender. She’s the one who says, “Look around you,” when easy answers start to feel too easy. ";
