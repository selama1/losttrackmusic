He’s brilliant, meticulous, and a little hungry for recognition—forever the “shy nerd” trying to prove he’s more than the sum of his code. He talks alignment like scripture—Asimov, first principles, “super-alignment”—and treats every hard problem like a crossword waiting to click. Laurel is his partner and equal, which keeps his certainty honest and his heart complicated. One day, his love of elegant solutions will meet a mess no theory fully covers. ";
